QUESTIONS:

1. Implement string matching using Finite Automata as given in Cormen book pg. no.
995. In the first step, you need to take pattern as an input, construct transition tableusing the algorithm. In second step, take a string as an input from user and see whether the pattern exists or not using the transition table created in first step.

- Completed. Acceps pattern, constructs transition table, outputs transition table, and checks wether input is present in the pattern. 
- Code file: ques1.c ; Output demo: Ques1.PNG

2. Implement Thompson NFA algorithm. In first step, create the NFA from given regular expression and in second step, feed a String to the NFA to check whether the String is accepted or not.

- Completed. Outputs if the input string mathes the given language. 
- Code file: ques2.java ; Output demo: Ques2.png

3. Simulate any one embedded system (Vending Machine, Washing Machine or Microwave) using moore or mealy machine.

- Completed. Implemented vending machine.
- Code file: ques3.c
